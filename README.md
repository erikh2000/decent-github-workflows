# Decent Github Workflows

These reusable workflows are designed for deploying and related actions on the Decent Portal. You're welcome to use them however you like, but most people will only find them useful if:

* You're building a Decent app using the [create-decent-app](https://github.com/erikh2000/create-decent-app) code generator.
* You want that app to deploy to the [Decent Portal](https://decentapps.net).
* Your app has been approved for portal hosting and you've received the necessary deployment secrets/credentials.

If all of the above apply and you're just looking to get things working, the [create-decent-app](https://github.com/erikh2000/create-decent-app) documentation has all the setup instructions you need.
